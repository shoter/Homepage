# Determining cause of aborted transaction

I stumbled upon a problem in which my Transaction was being aborted somewhere in the code and I did not know where because there was going a lot of things in this transaction.

When my code hit the exception due to wrong transaction state I did not know where the problem actually lies so I decided to attach function to TransactionCompleted event. Function would notify me when my transaction completed with aborted status. Then i would know exact place and with it a cause of aborted transaction.


```csharp
private static void Transaction_TransactionCompleted(object sender, TransactionEventArgs e)
        {
            if (e.Transaction.TransactionInformation.Status == TransactionStatus.Aborted)
            {
                if (System.Diagnostics.Debugger.IsAttached)
                    System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break();
            }
        }
```

Above is the method which was attached to TransactionCompleted event of System.Transactions.Transaction.Current at the start of TransactionScope.

Maybe there are better ways to debug this case but this one is simple one and shows exact place where status of the transaction changed.
