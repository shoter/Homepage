# I can code

My homepage is under construction. 

It will come to completion shortly. Deployed using Ci/CD with Jenkins.

## It will be able to display code in windows!

```js
var React = require('react');
var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

React.render(
  <Markdown source="# Your markdown here" />,
  document.getElementById('content')
);
```
