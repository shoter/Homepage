![Custom view engine before. Not tidy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shoter/Homepage/master/media/cve1.png)

So much views. So much views to display. By default ASP.NET MVC uses 2 default engines with a lot of searching for all possible language to find a view. It’s nasty to debug because it is increasing the number of entries that are trying to be rendered in glimpse/views tab.

I will not write whole article about how to remove unecessary WebFormViewEngine but I will leave link to article that I used to tidy my project -> Article from c-sharpcorner.com.

This is the result. Now my project looks mory tidy and it’s easier to navigate through views.
