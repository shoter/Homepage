# How to host create-app react template application on Github Pages

1. Go into settings of your project

I just had following error when building C# project:

```
    3>Cannot use stream for resource [C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\3.0.0\Microsoft.NETCore.App.deps.json]: No such file or directory
    3>A fatal error was encountered. The library 'hostpolicy.dll' required to execute the application was not found in 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\3.0.0'.
```

It turned out that folder `C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\3.0.0` was empty and deleting folder helped.
