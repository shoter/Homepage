# Preface

I was wondering recently what one need to do in order to properly setup sharded SQL instances. 
I am writing this part of article before I begin my work on understanding how to setup such thing.

My plan is as follows:
- Have simple SQL schema which consists of 2 tables: `Customers` and `Orders`
- Each table has `CustomerId` column which is going to serve as a key for sharding SQL servers.
- Data for given customer should reside only on 1 specific instance of SQL servers
- I do not plan to write any C# code
- Everything needs to be dockerized and easy to setup
